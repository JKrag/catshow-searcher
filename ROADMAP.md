# Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Quick wins & data quality

### #5 Country normalization ✅
Done. `src/lib/normalize-country.ts` — strips TICA's `Regional`/`Region` suffix and maps
~25 non-English country names to English canonical forms. Applied in `upsertShows` so it
covers all orgs automatically. Store migration backfills existing blob data on load.

**Deferred:** The alias table is static and silently passes through unknown strings. Extend
it whenever a new non-English or oddly-formatted country appears in scraped data.

### #7 + #13 — TICA direct link & show detail fetching ✅
Done. URL fixed to `shows#show{id}` format. `parseTicaDetail()` / `fetchTicaDetail()`
implemented in `src/lib/scrapers/tica.ts` and wired into `runAllScrapers` as a batch step
(see #6 / #14 below).

---

## Phase 2 — Architecture

### #6 — Separate TICA/FIFe handling ✅
Done. `Show` is now a `FifeShow | TicaShow` discriminated union; `NormalisedShow` is split
into `NormalisedFifeShow | NormalisedTicaShow`. Each org carries its own extended fields
without polluting the shared schema. Store migration is one-pass and idempotent.

---

## Phase 3 — Data enrichment

### #14 — Show format / show type field ✅
Done. Both orgs fetch per-show detail pages as a batch step after the main calendar scrape
(rate-limited to 1 req/sec, budget-capped at 30/run per org; `detail_fetched` flag prevents
re-fetching).

- **TICA:** `show_format` (e.g. "Alternative") parsed from the detail endpoint.
- **FIFe:** `show_type` (e.g. "Two 1 day, 2 cert.") parsed from the event page on fifeweb.org.

Both fields are displayed below the title in the list view.

### #8 — External links (flyer / show website) ✅
Done alongside #14.

- **TICA:** `flyer_url` parsed from the detail endpoint; displayed as a 📄 link.
- **FIFe:** `website_url` (organizer's site from JSON-LD) parsed from event pages; displayed
  as a 🌐 link.

Both links appear in the list view alongside the source ↗ link.

## Phase 4 — Quality gates

### #9 — Unit tests ✅
Done. Vitest with node environment and `@/*` alias. Run with `npm test` (one-shot) or
`npm run test:watch` (watch mode). 43 tests across 4 files:
- `src/lib/scrapers/__tests__/fife.test.ts` — `parseICal`, `parseFifeDetail`
- `src/lib/scrapers/__tests__/tica.test.ts` — `parseTica`, `parseTicaDetail`
- `src/lib/__tests__/normalize-country.test.ts` — `normalizeCountry`
- `src/lib/__tests__/shows-repo.test.ts` — `upsertShows`, `setFifeDetail`, `setTicaDetail`,
  `listFifeShowsMissingDetail`, `listTicaShowsMissingDetail`

Tests cover the critical "preserve detail fields on update" path in `upsertShows`.

### #10 — CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) ✅
Done. GitHub Actions workflow triggers on pull_request to main. Runs `npm ci` + `npm test`
(Vitest) on Node 22. Lint and build checks deferred — test coverage is the critical gate.

---

## Phase 5 — Big-picture UX

### #11 — Redesign for user groups (Epic) ✅
Done. Three URL-based persona routes implemented:

- `/` — **Visitor**: map default, minimal sidebar (date + country + distance, 200 km default, 500 km max, "Show all" checkbox), no org/search filters
- `/exhibitor` — **Exhibitor**: full sidebar with all 5 sections, list default, show_type/format/links all shown
- `/organizer` — **Organizer**: stub with "Timeline view coming soon" placeholder

Shared hooks (`useShows`, `useRoutes`), `PersonaNav` component, and `haversine.ts` utility extracted/created. `FilterSidebar` and `ShowList` both accept a `variant` prop.

**Deferred to follow-up issues:** judge names, AB/SP ring counts, entry fees, opening hours, and the full organizer timeline/spacing-rule engine.

### #12 — Internationalization
The domain `katteudstilling.dk` suggests a Danish entry point alongside an international one.
Add multi-language support once the UI is stable. Doing this last avoids duplicating i18n work
on components that are still changing.
